# IAM Best Practices

* Donâ€™t use the root account except for AWS account setup
* One physical user = One AWS user
* Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups
* Create a strong password policy
* Use and enforce the use of Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
* Create and use Roles for giving permissions to AWS services
* Use Access Keys for Programmatic Access (CLI / SDK)
* Audit permissions of your account with the IAM Credentials Report
* Never share IAM users & Access Keys
