# IAM Password Policy

* Strong passwords = higher security for your account
* In AWS, you can setup a password policy:
  * Set a minimum password length
  * Require specific character types:
    * including uppercase letters
    * lowercase letters
    * numbers
    * non-alphanumeric characters
  * Allow all IAM users to change their own passwords
  * Require users to change their password after some time (password expiration)
  * Prevent password re-use

## MFA

* Users have access to your account and can possibly change
configurations or delete resources in your AWS account
* You want to protect your Root Accounts and IAM users
* MFA = password you know + security device you own
* Main benefit of MFA: if a password is stolen or hacked, the account is not compromised
