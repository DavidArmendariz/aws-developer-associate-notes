# EBS Volume Types

* EBS Volumes come in 6 types
  * gp2 / gp3 (SSD): General purpose SSD volume that balances price and performance for
  a wide variety of workloads
  * io1 / io2 (SSD): Highest-performance SSD volume for mission-critical low-latency or
  high-throughput workloads
  * st1 (HDD): Low cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed, throughput-
  intensive workloads
  * sc1 (HDD): Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads
* EBS Volumes are characterized in Size | Throughput | IOPS (I/O Ops Per Sec)
* When in doubt always consult the AWS documentation – it’s good!
* Only gp2/gp3 and io1/io2 can be used as boot volumes

## General Purpose SSD

* Cost effective storage, low-latency
* System boot volumes, Virtual desktops, Development and test environments
* 1 GiB - 16 TiB
* gp3:
  * Baseline of 3,000 IOPS and throughput of 125 MiB/s
  * Can increase IOPS up to 16,000 and throughput up to 1000 MiB/s independently
* gp2:
  * Small gp2 volumes can burst IOPS to 3,000
  * Size of the volume and IOPS are linked, max IOPS is 16,000
  * 3 IOPS per GB, means at 5,334 GB we are at the max IOPS

## Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS) SSD

* Critical business applications with sustained IOPS performance
* Or applications that need more than 16,000 IOPS
* Great for databases workloads (sensitive to storage perf and consistency)
* io1/io2 (4 GiB - 16 TiB):
  * Max PIOPS: 64,000 for Nitro EC2 instances & 32,000 for other
  * Can increase PIOPS independently from storage size
  * io2 have more durability and more IOPS per GiB (at the same price as io1)
* io2 Block Express (4 GiB – 64 TiB):
  * Sub-millisecond latency
  * Max PIOPS: 256,000 with an IOPS:GiB ratio of 1,000:1
  * Supports EBS Multi-attach

## Hard Disk Drives

* Cannot be a boot volume
* 125 MiB to 16 TiB
* Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)
  * Big Data, Data Warehouses, Log Processing
  * Max throughput 500 MiB/s – max IOPS 500
* Cold HDD (sc1):
  * For data that is infrequently accessed
  * Scenarios where lowest cost is important
  * Max throughput 250 MiB/s – max IOPS 250
