# What is an EBS Volume?

* An EBS (Elastic Block Store) Volume is a network drive you can attach to your instances while they run
* It allows your instances to persist data, even after their termination
* They can only be mounted to one instance at a time (at the CCP level)
* They are bound to a **specific availability zone**
* Analogy: Think of them as a “network USB stick”
* Free tier: 30 GB of free EBS storage of type General Purpose (SSD) or Magnetic per mont

## EBS Volume

* It’s a network drive (i.e. not a physical drive)
  * It uses the network to communicate to the instance, which means there might be a bit of latency
  * It can be detached from an EC2 instance and attached to another one quickly
* It’s locked to an Availability Zone (AZ)
  * An EBS Volume in us-east-1a cannot be attached to us-east-1b
  * To move a volume across, you first need to snapshot it
* Have a provisioned capacity (size in GBs, and IOPS)
  * You get billed for all the provisioned capacity
  * You can increase the capacity of the drive over time

## DeleteOnTermination attribute

* Controls the EBS behaviour when an EC2 instance terminates
  * By default, the root EBS volume is deleted (attribute enabled)
  * By default, any other attached EBS volume is not deleted (attribute disabled)
* This can be controlled by the AWS console / AWS CLI
* Use case: preserve root volume when instance is terminated
