# Network Load Balancer

* Network load balancers (Layer 4) allow to:
  * Forward TCP & UDP traffic to your instances
  * Handle millions of request per seconds
  * Less latency ~100 ms (vs 400 ms for ALB)
* NLB has one static IP per AZ, and supports assigning Elastic IP (helpful for whitelisting specific IP)
* NLB are used for extreme performance, TCP or UDP traffic
* Not included in the AWS free tier
