# AWS SDK Overview

* What if you want to perform actions on AWS directly from your applications code ? (without using the CLI).
* You can use an SDK (software development kit) !
* Official SDKs are...
  * Java
  * .NET
  * Node.js
  * PHP
  * Python (named boto3 / botocore)
  * Go
  * Ruby
  * C++
* We have to use the AWS SDK when coding against AWS Services such as DynamoDB
* Fun fact... the AWS CLI uses the Python SDK (boto3)
* The exam expects you to know when you should use an SDK
* We’ll practice the AWS SDK when we get to the Lambda functions
* Good to know: if you don’t specify or configure a default region, then
us-east-1 will be chosen by default
