# AWS CLI Credentials Provider Chain

* The CLI will look for credentials in this order

1. Command line options – --region, --output, and --profile
2. Environment variables – AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
3. CLI credentials file –aws configure
`~/.aws/credentials` on Linux / Mac & `C:\Users\user\.aws\credentials` on Windows
4. CLI configuration file – aws configure
`~/.aws/config` on Linux / macOS & `C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\config` on Windows
5. Container credentials – for ECS tasks
6. Instance profile credentials – for EC2 Instance Profiles

## AWS SDK Default Credentials Provider Chain

* The Java SDK (example) will look for credentials in this order

1. Java system properties – aws.accessKeyId and aws.secretKey
2. Environment variables – AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
3. The default credential profiles file – ex at: `~/.aws/credentials`, shared by many SDK
4. Amazon ECS container credentials – for ECS containers
5. Instance profile credentials– used on EC2 instances

## AWS Credentials Scenario

* An application deployed on an EC2 instance is using environment variables with credentials from an IAM user to call the Amazon S3 API.
* The IAM user has S3FullAccess permissions.
* The application only uses one S3 bucket, so according to best practices:
  * An IAM Role & EC2 Instance Profile was created for the EC2 instance
  * The Role was assigned the minimum permissions to access that one S3 bucket
* The IAM Instance Profile was assigned to the EC2 instance, but it still had
access to all S3 buckets. Why?
  * the credentials chain is still giving priorities to the environment variables

## AWS Credentials Best Practices

* Overall, NEVER EVER STORE AWS CREDENTIALS IN YOUR CODE
* Best practice is for credentials to be inherited from the credentials chain
* If using working within AWS, use IAM Roles
  * => EC2 Instances Roles for EC2 Instances
  * => ECS Roles for ECS tasks
  * => Lambda Roles for Lambda functions
* If working outside of AWS, use environment variables / named profiles
