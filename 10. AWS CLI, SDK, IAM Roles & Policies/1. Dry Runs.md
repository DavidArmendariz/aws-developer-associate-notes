# AWS CLI Dry Runs

* Sometimes, we’d just like to make sure we have the permissions…
* But not actually run the commands!
* Some AWS CLI commands (such as EC2) can become expensive if they succeed, say if we wanted to try to create an EC2 Instance
* Some AWS CLI commands (not all) contain a --dry-run option to simulate API calls
