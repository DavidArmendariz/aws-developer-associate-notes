# AWS EC2 Instance Metadata

* AWS EC2 Instance Metadata is powerful but one of the least known features to developers
* It allows AWS EC2 instances to ”learn about themselves” without using an IAM Role for that purpose.
* The URL is `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data`
* You can retrieve the IAM Role name from the metadata, but you CANNOT retrieve the IAM Policy.
* Metadata = Info about the EC2 instance
* Userdata = launch script of the EC2 instance
