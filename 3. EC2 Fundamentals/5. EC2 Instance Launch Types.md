# EC2 Instances Purchasing Options

* On-Demand Instances: short workload, predictable pricing
* Reserved: (MINIMUM 1 year)
  * Reserved Instances: long workloads
  * Convertible Reserved Instances: long workloads with flexible instances
  * Scheduled Reserved Instances: example – every Thursday between 3 and 6 pm
* Spot Instances: short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)
* Dedicated Hosts: book an entire physical server, control instance placement
* Dedicated Instances: no other customers will share your hardware

## EC2 on demand

* Pay for what you use:
  * Linux - billing per second, after the first minute
  * All other operating systems (ex: Windows) - billing per hour
* Has the highest cost but no upfront payment
* No long-term commitment
* Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where you can't predict how the application will behave

## EC2 Reserved Instances

* Up to 72% discount compared to On-demand
* Reservation period: 1 year = + discount | 3 years = +++ discount
* Purchasing options: no upfront | partial upfront = + | All upfront = ++ discount
* Reserve a specific instance type
* Recommended for steady-state usage applications (think database)
* **Convertible Reserved Instance**
  * can change the EC2 instance type
  * Up to 45% discount
* **Scheduled Reserved Instances**
  * launch within time window you reserve
  * When you require a fraction of day / week / month
  * Commitment for 1 year only

## EC2 Spot Instances

* Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On-demand
* Instances that you can “lose” at any point of time if your max price is less than the current spot price
* The MOST cost-efficient instances in AWS
* Useful for workloads that are resilient to failure
  * Batch jobs
  * Data analysis
  * Image processing
  * Any distributed workloads
  * Workloads with a flexible start and end time
* Not suitable for critical jobs or databases

## EC2 Dedicated Hosts

* An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server with EC2 instance
capacity fully dedicated to your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you
address compliance requirements and reduce costs by allowing you to
use your existing server-bound software licenses.
* Allocated for your account for a 3-year period reservation
* More expensive
* Useful for software that have complicated licensing model (BYOL –
Bring Your Own License)
* Or for companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs

## EC2 Dedicated Instances

* Instances running on hardware that’s dedicated to you
* May share hardware with other instances in same account
* No control over instance placement (can move hardware after Stop / Start)
