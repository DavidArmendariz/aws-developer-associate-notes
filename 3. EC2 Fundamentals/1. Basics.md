# Amazon EC2

* EC2 is one of the most popular of AWSâ€™ offering
* EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
* It mainly consists in the capability of :
  * Renting virtual machines (EC2)
  * Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
  * Distributing load across machines (ELB)
  * Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
* Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works

## EC2 sizing and configuration options

* Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows or Mac OS
* How much compute power & cores (CPU)
* How much random-access memory (RAM)
* How much storage space:
  * Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
  * hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
* Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address
* Firewall rules: security group
* Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data

## EC2 User Data

* It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script.
* bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
* That script is only run once at the instance first start
* EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
  * Installing updates
  * Installing software
  * Downloading common files from the internet
  * Anything you can think of
* The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user
