# Elastic Load Balancing Overview

* Load balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers (EC2 Instances) downstream.

## Why use a load balancer?

* Spread load across multiple downstream instances
* Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application
* Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances
* Do regular health checks to your instances
* Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites
* Enforce stickiness with cookies
* High availability across zones
* Separate public traffic from private traffic

## Why use an EC2 Load Balancer?

* An ELB (EC2 Load Balancer) is a managed load balancer
  * AWS guarantees that it will be working
  * AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high availability
  * AWS provides only a few configuration knobs
* It costs less to setup your own load balancer but it will be a lot more effort on your end.
* It is integrated with many AWS offerings / services

## Health Checks

* Health Checks are crucial for Load Balancers
* They enable the load balancer to know if instances it forwards traffic to are available to reply to requests
* The health check is done on a port and a route (/health is common)
* If the response is not 200 (OK), then the instance is unhealthy

## Types of load balancer on AWS

* AWS has 3 kinds of managed Load Balancers
* Classic Load Balancer (v1 - old generation) – 2009
  * HTTP, HTTPS, TCP
* Application Load Balancer (v2 - new generation) – 2016
  * HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket
* Network Load Balancer (v2 - new generation) – 2017
  * TCP, TLS (secure TCP) & UDP
* Overall, it is recommended to use the newer / v2 generation load balancers as they provide more features
* You can setup internal (private) or external (public) ELBs

## Load Balancer Good to Know

* LBs can scale but not instantaneously – contact AWS for a “warm-up”
* Troubleshooting
  * 4xx errors are client induced errors
  * 5xx errors are application induced errors
  * Load Balancer Errors 503 means at capacity or no registered target
  * If the LB can’t connect to your application, check your security groups!
* Monitoring
  * ELB access logs will log all access requests (so you can debug per request)
  * CloudWatch Metrics will give you aggregate statistics (ex: connections count)
