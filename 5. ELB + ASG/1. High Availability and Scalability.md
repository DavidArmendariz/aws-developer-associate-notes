# Scalability and Hihg Availability

* Scalability means that an application / system can handle greater loads by adapting.
* There are two kinds of scalability:
  * Vertical Scalability
  * Horizontal Scalability (= elasticity)
* Scalability is linked but different to High Availability

## Vertical scalability

* Vertically scalability means increasing the size of the instance
* For example, your application runs on a t2.micro
* Scaling that application vertically means running it on a t2.large
* Vertical scalability is very common for non distributed systems, such as a database.
* RDS, ElastiCache are services that can scale vertically.
* There’s usually a limit to how much you can vertically scale (hardware limit)

## Horizontal scalability

* Horizontal Scalability means increasing the number of instances / systems for your application
* Horizontal scaling implies distributed systems.
* This is very common for web applications / modern applications
* It’s easy to horizontally scale thanks the cloud offerings such as Amazon EC2

## High Availability

* High Availability usually goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling
* High availability means running your application / system in at least 2 data centers (== Availability Zones)
* The goal of high availability is to survive a data center loss
* The high availability can be passive (for RDS Multi AZ for example)
* The high availability can be active (for horizontal scaling)
