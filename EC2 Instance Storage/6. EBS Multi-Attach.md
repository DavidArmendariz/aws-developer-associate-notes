# EBS Multi-Attach

* Attach the same EBS volume to multiple
EC2 instances in the same AZ
* Each instance has full read & write
permissions to the volume
* Use case:
  * Achieve higher application availability in clustered Linux applications (ex: Teradata)
  * Applications must manage concurrent write operations
* Must use a file system thatâ€™s cluster-aware (not XFS, EX4, etc...)
