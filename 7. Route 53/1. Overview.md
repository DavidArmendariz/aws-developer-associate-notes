# AWS Route 53 Overview

* Route53 is a managed DNS (Domain Name System)
* DNS is a collection of rules and records which helps clients understand how to reach a server through its domain name
* In AWS, the most common records are:
  * A: hostname to IPv4
  * AAAA: hostname to IPv6
  * CNAME: hostname to hostname
  * Alias: hostname to AWS resource
* Route53 can use:
  * public domain names you own (or buy)
    * app.mydomain.com
  * private domain names that can be resolved by your instances in your VPCs
    * app.company.internal
* Route53 has advanced features such as:
  * Load balancing (through DNS - also called client load balancing)
  * Health checks (although limited...)
  * Routing policy: simple, failover, geolocation, latency, weighted, multi value
* You pay $0.50 per month per hosted zone
