# Domain Registrar vs DNS Service

* You buy or register your domain name with a Domain Registrar typically by paying annual charges
* The Domain Registrar usually provides you with a DNS service to manage your DNS records
* But you can use another DNS service to manage your DNS records
* Example: purchase the domain from GoDaddy and use Route 53 to manage your DNS records

1. Create a Hosted Zone in Route 53
2. Update NS Records on 3rd party website to use Route 53 Name Servers
