# CNAME vs Alias

* AWS resources (Load Balancer, CloudFront...) expose an AWS Hostname: `lbl-123.us-east-2.elb.amasonaws.com` and you want `myapp.domain.com`.
* CNAME
  * Points a hostname to any other hostname (`app.mydomain.com` -> `blabla.anything.com`)
  * ONLY FOR NON ROOT DOMAIN (ex. `something.mydomain.com`)
* ALIAS
  * Points to hostname to an AWS Resource (`app.mydomain.com` -> `blabla.amazonaws.com`)
  * Works for ROOT DOMAIN and NON ROOT DOMAIN
  * Free of charge
  * Native health check
