* Route traffic to your resources based on the geographic location of users and resources
* Ability to shift more traffic to resources based on the defined bias
* To change the size of the geographic region, specify bias values:
* To expand (1 to 99) – more traffic to the resource
* To shrink (-1 to -99) – less traffic to the resource
* Resources can be:
* AWS resources (specify AWS region)
* Non-AWS resources (specify Latitude and Longitude)
* You must use Route 53 Traffic Flow (advanced) to use this feature
