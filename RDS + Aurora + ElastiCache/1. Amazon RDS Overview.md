# AWS RDS Overview

* RDS stands for Relational Database Service
* It’s a managed DB service for DB use SQL as a query language.
* It allows you to create databases in the cloud that are managed by AWS
  * Postgres
  * MySQL
  * MariaDB
  * Oracle
  * Microsoft SQL Server
  * Aurora (AWS Proprietary database)

## Advantages of using RDS versus deploying DB on EC2

* RDS is a managed service:
  * Automated provisioning, OS patching
  * Continuous backups and restore to specific timestamp (Point in Time Restore)!
  * Monitoring dashboards
  * Read replicas for improved read performance
  * Multi AZ setup for DR (Disaster Recovery)
  * Maintenance windows for upgrades
  * Scaling capability (vertical and horizontal)
  * Storage backed by EBS (gp2 or io1)
* BUT you can’t SSH into your instances

## RDS Backups

* Backups are automatically enabled in RDS
* Automated backups:
  * Daily full backup of the database (during the maintenance window)
  * Transaction logs are backed-up by RDS every 5 minutes
  * => ability to restore to any point in time (from oldest backup to 5 minutes ago)
  * 7 days retention (can be increased to 35 days)
* DB Snapshots:
  * Manually triggered by the user
  * Retention of backup for as long as you want

## Storage Auto Scaling

* Helps you increase storage on your RDS DB instance dynamically
* When RDS detects you are running out of free database storage, it scales automatically
* Avoid manually scaling your database storage
* You have to set Maximum Storage Threshold (maximum limit for DB storage)
* Automatically modify storage if:
  * Free storage is less than 10% of allocated storage
  * Low-storage lasts at least 5 minutes
  * 6 hours have passed since last modification
* Useful for applications with unpredictable workloads
* Supports all RDS database engines (MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle)
