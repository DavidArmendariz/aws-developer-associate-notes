# VPC Peering

* Connect two VPC, privately using AWSâ€™ network
* Make them behave as if they were in the same network
* Must not have overlapping CIDR (IP address range)
* VPC Peering connection is not transitive (must be established for each VPC that need to communicate with one another)

## VPC Endpoints

* Endpoints allow you to connect to AWS Services using a private network instead of the public www network
* This gives you enhanced security and lower latency to access AWS services
* VPC Endpoint Gateway: S3 & DynamoDB
* VPC Endpoint Interface: the rest
* Only used within your VPC
