# S3 MFA Delete

* MFA (multi factor authentication) forces user to generate a code on a device (usually a mobile phone or hardware) before doing important operations on S3
* To use MFA-Delete, enable Versioning on the S3 bucket
* You will need MFA to
  * permanently delete an object version
  * suspend versioning on the bucket
* You wonâ€™t need MFA for
  * enabling versioning
  * listing deleted versions
* Only the bucket owner (root account) can enable/disable MFA-Delete
* MFA-Delete currently can only be enabled using the CLI
