# S3 Pre-Signed URLs

* Can generate pre-signed URLs using SDK or CLI
  * For downloads (easy, can use the CLI)
  * For uploads (harder, must use the SDK)
* Valid for a default of 3600 seconds, can change timeout with `--expires-in`
[TIME_BY_SECONDS] argument
* Users given a pre-signed URL inherit the permissions of the person who generated the URL for GET / PUT
* Examples:
  * Allow only logged-in users to download a premium video on your S3 bucket
  * Allow an ever changing list of users to download files by generating URLs dynamically
  * Allow temporarily a user to upload a file to a precise location in our bucket

```ssh
aws s3 presign s3://[BUCKET]/[OBJECT] --region [MY_REGION] --expires-in [TIME_BY_SECONDS]
```

If you are having issues:

```ssh
aws configure set default.s3.signature_version s3v4
```
