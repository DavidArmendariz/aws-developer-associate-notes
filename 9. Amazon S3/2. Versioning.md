# Versioning

* You can version your files in Amazon S3
* It is enabled at the bucket level
* Same key overwrite will increment the “version”: 1, 2, 3….
* It is best practice to version your buckets
  * Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version)
  * Easy roll back to previous version
* Notes:
  * Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have version “null”
  * Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions
