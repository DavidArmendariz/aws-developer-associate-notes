# Amazon S3

* Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in “buckets” (directories)
* Buckets must have a globally unique name
* Buckets are defined at the region level
* Naming convention
  * No uppercase
  * No underscore
  * 3-63 characters long
  * Not an IP
  * Must start with lowercase letter or number

## Objects

* Objects (files) have a Key
* The key is the FULL path:
  * s3://my-bucket/my_file.txt
  * s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt
* The key is composed of prefix + object name
  * s3://my-bucket/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt
* There’s no concept of “directories” within buckets (although the UI will trick you to think otherwise)
* Just keys with very long names that contain slashes (“/”)
* Object values are the content of the body:
  * Max Object Size is 5TB (5000GB)
  * If uploading more than 5GB, must use “multi-part upload”
* Metadata (list of text key / value pairs – system or user metadata)
* Tags (Unicode key / value pair – up to 10) – useful for security / lifecycle
* Version ID (if versioning is enabled)
