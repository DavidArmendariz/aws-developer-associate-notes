# Consistency Model

* Strong consistency as of Dec 2020:
* After a:
  * successful write of a new object (new PUT)
  * or an overwrite or delete of an existing object (overwrite PUT or DELETE)
* ...any:
  * subsequent read request immediately receives the latest version of the object
  (read after write consistency)
  * subsequent list request immediately reflects changes
  (list consistency)
* Available at no additional cost, without any performance impact
