# S3 Security

* User based
  * IAM policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM
console
* Resource Based
  * Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
  * Object Access Control List (ACL) – finer grain
  * Bucket Access Control List (ACL) – less common
* Note: an IAM principal can access an S3 object if
  * the user IAM permissions allow it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it
  * AND there’s no explicit DENY

## S3 Bucket Policies

* JSON based policies
  * Resources: buckets and objects
  * Actions: Set of API to Allow or Deny
  * Effect: Allow / Deny
  * Principal: The account or user to apply the policy to
* Use S3 bucket for policy to:
  * Grant public access to the bucket
  * Force objects to be encrypted at upload
  * Grant access to another account (Cross Account)

## Bucket settings for Block Public Access

* Block public access to buckets and objects granted through
  * new access control lists (ACLs)
  * any access control lists (ACLs)
  * new public bucket or access point policies
* Block public and cross-account access to buckets and objects
through any public bucket or access point policies
* These settings were created to prevent company data leaks
* If you know your bucket should never be public, leave these on
* Can be set at the account level

## Other

* Networking:
  * Supports VPC Endpoints (for instances in VPC without www internet)
* Logging and Audit:
  * S3 Access Logs can be stored in other S3 bucket
  * API calls can be logged in AWS CloudTrail
* User Security:
  * MFA Delete: MFA (multi factor authentication) can be required in versioned
  buckets to delete objects
  * Pre-Signed URLs: URLs that are valid only for a limited time (ex: premium video
  service for logged in users)
