# EC2 Instance Types

* You can use different types of EC2 instances that are optimised for
different use cases (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)
* AWS has the following naming convention: **m5.2xlarge**
* m: instance class
* 5: generation (AWS improves them over time)
* 2xlarge: size within the instance class

## General Purpose

* Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
  * Balance between:
  * Compute
  * Memory
  * Networking

## Compute Optimized

* Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance
processors:
  * Batch processing workloads
  * Media transcoding
  * High performance web servers
  * High performance computing (HPC)
  * Scientific modeling & machine learning
  * Dedicated gaming servers

## Memory Optimized

* Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
* Use cases:
  * High performance, relational/non-relational databases
  * Distributed web scale cache stores
  * In-memory databases optimized for BI (business intelligence)
  * Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data

## Storage Optimized

* Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write
access to large data sets on local storage
* Use cases:
  * High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
  * Relational & NoSQL databases
  * Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis)
  * Data warehousing applications
  * Distributed file systems
