# Introduction to Security Groups

* Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
* They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances.
EC2 Instance
* Security groups only contain **allow** rules
* Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group
* Security groups are acting as a “firewall” on EC2 instances
* They regulate:
  * Access to Ports
  * Authorised IP ranges – IPv4 and IPv6
  * Control of inbound network (from other to the instance)
  * Control of outbound network (from the instance to other)

## Good to know

* Can be attached to multiple instances
* Locked down to a region / VPC combination
* Does live “outside” the EC2 – if traffic is blocked the EC2 instance won’t see it
* It’s good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access
* If your application is not accessible (time out), then it’s a security group issue
* If your application gives a “connection refused“ error, then it’s an application
error or it’s not launched
* All inbound traffic is blocked by default
* All outbound traffic is authorised by default

## Classic Ports to know

* 22 = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into a Linux instance
* 21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – upload files into a file share
* 22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) – upload files using SSH
* 80 = HTTP – access unsecured websites
* 443 = HTTPS – access secured websites
* 3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) – log into a Windows instance
