# CloudFront Signed URL / Signed Cookies

* You want to distribute paid shared content to premium users over the world
* To Restrict Viewer Access, we can create a CloudFront Signed URL / Cookie
* How long should the URL be valid for?
  * Shared content (movie, music): make it short (a few minutes)
  * Private content (private to the user): you can make it last for years
* Signed URL = access to individual files (one signed URL per file)
* Signed Cookies = access to multiple files (one signed cookie for many files)
