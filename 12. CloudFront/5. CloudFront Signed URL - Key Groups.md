# CloudFront Signed URL Process

* Two types of signers:
  * Either a trusted key group (recommended)
    * Can leverage APIs to create and rotate keys (and IAM for API security)
  * An AWS Account that contains a CloudFront Key Pair
    * Need to manage keys using the root account and the AWS console
    * Not recommended because you shouldnâ€™t use the root account for this
* In your CloudFront distribution, create one or more trusted key groups
* You generate your own public / private key
  * The private key is used by your applications (e.g. EC2) to sign URLs
  * The public key (uploaded) is used by CloudFront to verify URLs
